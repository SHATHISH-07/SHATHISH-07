# Hi there, I’m Shathish Kumaran 👋

<h2>
A passionate Full-Stack Developer and Computer Science Engineering student who enjoys building secure, scalable, and real-world applications from the ground up.
</h2>

I primarily work within the **MERN ecosystem**, with strong interest in **backend architecture, security, and modern web technologies**. I enjoy solving complex problems, designing clean APIs, and turning ideas into production-ready applications.

I have completed industry-recognized certifications such as **Full Stack Open (University of Helsinki)** and the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, which strengthened both my development and security foundations. Currently, I am exploring advanced concepts like **GraphQL, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and cloud deployments** while actively collaborating on meaningful projects.
